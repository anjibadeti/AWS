## 🔹 What is AWS Direct Connect?

### ✅ Definition:

**AWS Direct Connect (DX)** is a **dedicated network connection** from your **on-premises data center or colocation environment** directly to AWS, bypassing the public internet.

It provides **high bandwidth**, **low latency**, and **consistent network performance**, especially beneficial for:

* High-throughput workloads
* Hybrid environments
* Real-time data transfer

## ✅ Direct Connect Key Concepts

| Concept                          | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct Connect Location**      | AWS data center or partner facility where the physical connection is established |
| **Virtual Interface (VIF)**      | Logical interface to connect to AWS resources                                    |
| **Private VIF**                  | Connects to a VPC using a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)                          |
| **Public VIF**                   | Connects to AWS public services like S3, DynamoDB                                |
| **Hosted Connection**            | Provisioned by AWS Partners instead of AWS directly                              |
| **Link Aggregation Group (LAG)** | Combine multiple connections for higher bandwidth and resiliency                 |

# 🧪 Real-Time Lab (Simulated): Direct Connect Setup Using Hosted Connection + Private VIF

> ⚠️ **Note**: Since actual Direct Connect requires physical cabling and colocation facilities, this lab simulates a **hosted Direct Connect** from a **partner** like Megaport or Equinix (which many companies use in production). You can explain this with **GUI-based walkthroughs + network topology**.

---

## 🎯 Scenario:

You're simulating an enterprise setting where the company uses **Megaport** to create a **hosted Direct Connect** to their **AWS VPC** in **Mumbai region**, with **Private VIF** for VPC access.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Simulation Guide

---

### 🔸 Step 1: Order Hosted Direct Connect (via Partner Console)

1. Go to a DX partner like **Megaport**
2. Choose **Hosted Direct Connect**
3. Set bandwidth (e.g., 1 Gbps)
4. Select **AWS Region** (Mumbai - ap-south-1)
5. Create **Virtual Cross Connect (VXC)** to AWS DX location
6. Once complete, you’ll receive:

   * **Connection ID** (e.g., `dxcon-abc123`)
   * **LOA-CFA (Letter of Authorization)**

---

### 🔸 Step 2: Accept Hosted Connection in AWS Console

1. Go to **Direct Connect → Connections**
2. You'll see a pending connection (`dxcon-abc123`)
3. Click **Accept**
4. Create a new **Virtual Interface**

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Create Private Virtual Interface (VIF)

1. Go to **Direct Connect > Virtual Interfaces**
2. Click **Create Virtual Interface**

   * Type: **Private**
   * Connection: select your hosted connection
   * VIF Name: `PrivateVIF`
   * VLAN: as provided by partner (e.g., 101)
   * BGP ASN: Use 65000 (or per your setup)
   * Prefix: `192.168.1.0/24` (on-prem network)
   * VGW: Select the **Virtual Private Gateway** attached to your VPC

✅ After creation, AWS will **establish a BGP session** with the on-prem router (simulated by Megaport or StrongSwan if needed).

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Attach Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) to VPC

1. Go to **VPC → Virtual Private Gateways**
2. Attach it to your **target VPC** (10.0.0.0/16)
3. Update the **VPC Route Table**:

   * Destination: `192.168.1.0/24`
   * Target: VGW

---

### 🔸 Step 5: On-Prem Routing (Simulated via VPN or StrongSwan)

> If you’re simulating, assume the on-prem side runs a BGP router (e.g., Cisco CSR1000v or StrongSwan+BGP)

Set up BGP to announce:

```bash
router bgp 65000
  neighbor <AWS_BGP_IP> remote-as <AWS_ASN>
  network 192.168.1.0
```

---

### 🔸 Step 6: Test Connectivity (EC2 ↔ On-Prem)

From **AWS EC2 in VPC**:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.10
```

From **On-prem machine**:

```bash
ping 10.0.0.10
```

✅ If routing and BGP are configured correctly, traffic will pass **privately via Direct Connect**.

---

## ✅ Monitoring and Logs

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**:

   * Connection state
   * Packet loss
   * Latency
2. **AWS DX Console**:

   * Tunnel status: `Up` or `Down`
3. **BGP Session Logs**:

   * Ensure BGP session is established and routes are advertised
