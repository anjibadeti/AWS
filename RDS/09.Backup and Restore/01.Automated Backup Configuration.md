## ‚úÖ Module 9: Backup and Restore

### üîπ Topic: **Automated Backup Configuration**

---

### üîç What is Automated Backup in RDS?

**Automated Backups** is a **built-in RDS feature** that enables **point-in-time recovery (PITR)** for your database instances. It automatically creates **snapshots** of your RDS instance and also backs up the **transaction logs** to enable restoring your database to any second within the backup retention window.

### üéØ Key Concepts to Explain to Students:

| Feature                | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retention Period**   | You can retain automated backups from 1 to 35 days.                                |
| **Storage**            | Backup storage is free up to the size of your DB instance (if instance is active). |
| **Recovery**           | Point-in-time recovery up to any specific time (within retention window).          |
| **Transactional Logs** | Captured every 5 minutes for PITR.                                                 |
| **Automatic**          | No need to trigger manually, once enabled it works in background.                  |

## üìò Use Case Example (Real-time)

**Scenario:**
Your company is running a production MySQL database on Amazon RDS for an e-commerce application. You want to make sure the database can be restored to any point in time if a data corruption or accidental deletion happens.

## üß™ Lab: Step-by-Step - Configure Automated Backups in Amazon RDS

---

### üîß **Step 1: Launch RDS DB Instance**

1. Go to AWS Console ‚Üí Services ‚Üí RDS.
2. Click on **‚ÄúCreate Database‚Äù**.
3. Select **Standard Create**.
4. Engine: Choose **MySQL**.
5. Template: Choose **Production**.
6. DB Instance Identifier: `ecommerce-db`
7. DB Instance Class: `db.t3.micro`
8. Storage: 20 GiB (GP2)
9. Enable storage autoscaling.

### üîê **Step 2: Configure Backups**

10. In **Backup Settings** section:

    * **Enable automated backups** ‚úÖ
    * **Backup retention period**: `7 days`
    * **Backup window**: Choose a preferred time (e.g., `03:00-04:00 UTC`)
    * **Enable Enhanced Monitoring (optional)**

---

### üåê **Step 3: Configure VPC and Connectivity**

11. Select an existing **VPC** or create a new one.
12. Ensure the **DB subnet group** covers at least **2 AZs**.
13. Choose **public access = No** (for production).
14. Add to an appropriate **security group** allowing MySQL (port 3306) inbound.

---

### üöÄ **Step 4: Launch and Monitor**

15. Click **Create database**.
16. Wait until the status is **Available**.
17. Go to **RDS Dashboard ‚Üí Databases ‚Üí ecommerce-db ‚Üí Maintenance & Backups tab**.

---

### üìÖ **Step 5: Verify Automated Backup Configuration**

* Verify:

  * Backup retention = 7 days
  * Automated backup is enabled ‚úÖ
* After a few minutes or hours, go to:

  * **RDS > Automated Backups** section
  * You will see an automatic snapshot created

---

## üîÅ Step 6: Perform Point-in-Time Recovery (Optional Demonstration)

1. Go to **Automated Backups**.
2. Select the DB instance ‚Üí Click **Restore to point in time**.
3. Choose a time (e.g., a few minutes back).
4. Provide a new instance name: `ecommerce-db-restore`
5. Click **Restore**.

This step restores your DB to a specific time if data loss happens.

## ‚úÖ When to Use in Real-World

* **Data corruption** (e.g., DELETE query without WHERE).
* **Application bug** that writes incorrect values.
* **Need to rollback to yesterday‚Äôs data.**
* Ensuring **business continuity** without manual backup overhead.
