## ✅ **Module 9: Backup and Restore**

### 🔸 Topic: Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

---

## 📘 **Concept Explanation**

**Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** allows you to restore an RDS DB instance to **any specific time** within your automated backup retention period. Unlike restoring from a snapshot (which is static), PITR uses:

* **Automated Backups**
* **Transaction Logs**
  to recreate the DB state at a specific point.

---

### 🔍 **How PITR Works in RDS**

1. Amazon RDS continuously backs up your database during the backup window.
2. It also captures transaction logs every 5 minutes.
3. PITR allows you to recreate the DB at any **second-level time** within the backup window.

> 🕒 Retention window: Default is 7 days (can be configured up to 35 days).

## ✅ **Real-Time Use Case**

You are managing a production RDS instance `billing-db`. At **10:30 AM**, a developer accidentally deleted the `transactions` table. Instead of restoring from a full snapshot (which may be older), you want to **restore the DB to 10:29 AM** — **just one minute before the failure**.

## 🧪 **Step-by-Step Lab: Point-in-Time Recovery**

### 🛠️ **Lab Setup Prerequisites**

* A working **Amazon RDS MySQL or PostgreSQL instance** (e.g., `billing-db`).
* **Automated Backups** must be enabled.
* Some sample data inserted in advance.

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Enable Automated Backups (if not already)**

Go to:

* **RDS Console > Databases > billing-db**
* Modify > Enable **automated backups**
* Set backup window (e.g., 7 days)
* Apply Immediately

Wait for the changes to take effect.

### 🔹 **Step 2: Insert Sample Data**

Log in to your RDS instance using a client like **DBeaver**, **MySQL Workbench**, or **psql**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR(10)
);

INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (1, 100.00, 'Success');
INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (2, 200.00, 'Pending');
```

Note the **timestamp** of insertion (e.g., 10:20 AM).

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: Simulate Data Loss**

At **10:30 AM**, simulate accidental deletion.

```sql
DROP TABLE transactions;
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 4: Start Point-in-Time Restore**

Go to:

* **RDS Console > Databases > billing-db**
* Click **Actions > Restore to point in time**

Now:

* Choose **"Custom"**
* Enter **time = 10:29 AM**
* New DB identifier: `billing-db-restore`
* Select other config (instance type, VPC, etc.)
* Click **Restore DB Instance**

Wait 5–10 minutes.

---

### 🔹 **Step 5: Validate the Recovery**

Connect to the new instance:

* Use restored endpoint: `billing-db-restore.xxxxxx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
* Check if `transactions` table exists:

```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions;
```

✅ You should see the data as it was at 10:29 AM.

## 🟢 **Output / Validation**

| Item                 | Expected Result                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| DB Name              | `billing-db-restore`              |
| `transactions` Table | Exists                            |
| Data                 | Present till 10:29 AM             |
| Logs                 | Used to replay until desired time |

## 🎓 **Teaching Points**

| Topic                    | Student Learning Outcome                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| PITR vs Snapshot Restore | PITR is **second-level**, snapshots are **static** |
| Real-Time Scenario       | Mistaken data deletion                             |
| Cost Implication         | Charged for the new restored instance              |
| PITR Time Limitation     | Must be within retention window                    |
| Original DB Unaffected   | PITR creates a **new instance**                    |
