## ✅ **Module 9: Backup and Restore**

### 🔸 Topic: Restoring Snapshots

---

## 📘 **Concept Explanation**

**RDS Snapshots** are backups of your DB instances that you can use to restore your data to a specific point in time. Snapshots can be:

* **Manual Snapshots**: Taken by the user and stored until explicitly deleted.
* **Automated Snapshots**: Taken by AWS on your behalf within a defined retention window.

---

### 📌 Why We Restore Snapshots?

1. **Disaster Recovery**: If a database is corrupted or deleted.
2. **Testing**: To replicate a production DB in a dev/test environment.
3. **Data Analysis**: Access historical data without affecting production.
4. **Environment Duplication**: To create staging/UAT from production.

---

## ✅ **Real-Time Use Case**

Imagine your production RDS instance (`prod-db`) faced a schema migration failure. Your team decided to **roll back to the last known good state**. You can **restore from a manual snapshot taken before the deployment** to bring the DB back to that point.

## 🧪 **Step-by-Step Lab: Restoring RDS Snapshot**

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

* One **manual snapshot** created from an existing RDS instance (e.g., `prod-db-snapshot`).
* IAM permissions to perform RDS restore operations.
* AWS Console or CLI access.

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Go to RDS Console**

* Navigate to **Amazon RDS**.
* In the left pane, click on **Snapshots**.
* Filter by **Manual Snapshots**.
* Choose your snapshot: `prod-db-snapshot`.

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Restore Snapshot**

* Select the snapshot.
* Click **Actions > Restore Snapshot**.
* Enter the **new DB identifier**: e.g., `prod-db-rollback`.
* Select DB instance class (e.g., `db.t3.micro` for lab).
* Storage: Pick the same or bigger size as the source DB.
* Choose **VPC**, Subnet Group, and Security Group.
* Disable **Public Access** if not needed.
* Click **Restore DB Instance**.

> 🕒 It takes 5–10 minutes to restore.

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: Verify the DB**

* Go to **Databases** section.
* Look for `prod-db-rollback`.
* Wait until **status = Available**.
* Click the DB and **check endpoint** and **port**.

---

### 🔹 **Step 4: Connect & Validate**

Using an RDS client (like **DBeaver**, **SQL Workbench**, or **SSMS**):

* Endpoint: `prod-db-rollback.xxxxxx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
* Username & Password from snapshot config.
* Validate the data/schema.

---

### 🟢 Output / Validation

* DB instance `prod-db-rollback` is listed under RDS.
* Same schema and data as the snapshot’s source.
* Users can run queries to confirm successful rollback.

| Feature          | Explanation                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Snapshot         | Point-in-time backup of DB                       |
| Restore Snapshot | Creates a **new DB instance**                    |
| Use Case         | Disaster recovery, testing, cloning environments |
| Access           | Same credentials as original unless changed      |
| Cost             | Charged for the new instance after restore       |
