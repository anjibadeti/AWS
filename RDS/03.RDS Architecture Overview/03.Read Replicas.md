## ✅ **Module 3: RDS Architecture Overview → Read Replicas**

---

## 🔷 **What are Read Replicas in Amazon RDS?**

A **Read Replica** is a **read-only copy** of your primary (source) RDS database that stays **synchronously or asynchronously** updated. Read replicas allow you to **offload read-heavy workloads** (like reporting and analytics) from the primary DB instance to improve **performance and scalability**.

## 📘 **Key Features of Read Replicas**

| Feature                        | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read-only**                  | You can't write to a replica — used only for SELECT queries    |
| **Asynchronous Replication**   | Replica updates **after** primary writes                       |
| **Multiple Replicas**          | You can create up to **5 read replicas** per source DB         |
| **Cross-Region Replication**   | Replicas can be created in **another AWS region**              |
| **Promotion to Standalone DB** | You can **promote** a replica to become a standalone write DB  |
| **Automatic Monitoring**       | Uses CloudWatch, enhanced monitoring, and Performance Insights |

## 💡 **Use Case for Read Replicas**

> A **news website** (like NDTV.com) uses **MySQL RDS** for storing articles and user comments. During peak hours, the database becomes slow due to many users fetching articles (read-heavy). Instead of scaling the main DB, they create **2 Read Replicas** to offload traffic for article retrieval, keeping writes (new comments) on the primary.

## 🧪 **Step-by-Step Lab: Create and Test Read Replica in RDS**

---

### ✅ **Pre-Requisites:**

* AWS account with RDS access
* Existing RDS DB instance (MySQL/PostgreSQL supported)
* MySQL client (Workbench or EC2-based)

---

### 🎯 **Goal:**

1. Create an RDS MySQL instance (`primary-db`)
2. Create a Read Replica (`replica-db`)
3. Connect to both, run SELECT queries on replica
4. Test replication from primary to replica

---

## 🔧 **Lab Implementation**

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Create Primary MySQL RDS Instance

1. Go to `RDS Console → Databases → Create database`
2. Select:

   * Engine: **MySQL**
   * DB instance identifier: `primary-db`
   * Username: `admin`
   * Password: `ReadReplica123!`
   * DB instance class: `db.t3.micro`
3. Enable:

   * **Enable automated backups** ✅ (required for replica)
   * Public access: ✅ (for testing)
   * Port: `3306`
4. Choose VPC and subnet group
5. Click **Create Database**
6. Wait until the DB status is **Available**

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Connect to the Primary RDS DB

From EC2 or your machine with MySQL client:

```bash
mysql -h <primary-endpoint> -u admin -p
```

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Create Sample Database and Table

```sql
CREATE DATABASE productsdb;
USE productsdb;

CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10, 2),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES 
('Laptop', 75000.00),
('Headphones', 1500.00),
('Mobile Phone', 30000.00);
```

---

### 🔷 Step 4: Create a Read Replica

1. Go to `RDS Console → Databases`
2. Select your **primary-db**
3. Click **Actions → Create read replica**
4. Settings:

   * DB instance ID: `replica-db`
   * Instance class: `db.t3.micro`
   * Region: Same or different region
   * Public access: ✅
   * Keep defaults, click **Create read replica**
5. Wait until **replica-db** status is **Available**

---

### 🔷 Step 5: Connect to Replica DB

```bash
mysql -h <replica-endpoint> -u admin -p
```

Run:

```sql
USE productsdb;
SELECT * FROM products;
```

---

### 📤 Expected Output (on Replica):

```text
+----+--------------+---------+---------------------+
| id | name         | price   | updated_at          |
+----+--------------+---------+---------------------+
| 1  | Laptop       | 75000.00| 2025-07-08 14:22:10 |
| 2  | Headphones   | 1500.00 | 2025-07-08 14:22:45 |
| 3  | Mobile Phone | 30000.00| 2025-07-08 14:23:05 |
+----+--------------+---------+---------------------+
```

✅ You can read data from the replica but **cannot INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE**.

---

### 🔷 Step 6: Test Replication

On Primary DB:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Smartwatch', 5000.00);
```

On Replica DB:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

🎯 You will see **Smartwatch** appear after a few seconds — showing **replication success**.

---

### 🔷 Step 7: Optional — Promote Replica

You can **promote the Read Replica** to a **standalone DB instance**:

1. Go to RDS Console → replica-db
2. Actions → Promote read replica
3. Useful during failover or scaling
