### ðŸ”¹ Topic: VPC and Subnet Configuration for RDS

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Objective**

To help students understand how Amazon RDS is integrated into a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and how subnets play a crucial role in controlling accessibility, availability, and networking.

---

### ðŸ“˜ **What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?**

An **isolated network** in AWS where you can launch resources like EC2, RDS, etc. You define:

* IP range (CIDR block)
* Subnets (Public and Private)
* Route tables
* Internet Gateway/NAT Gateway
* Security groups and NACLs

---

### ðŸ“˜ **What is a Subnet?**

A **subnet is a portion of the VPC IP range**. Subnets are created in availability zones and categorized as:

* **Public subnet** â€“ has access to the internet (via IGW)
* **Private subnet** â€“ used for backend services like RDS, without direct internet access

---

### ðŸ“˜ **Why is Subnet Configuration Critical in RDS?**

Amazon RDS **requires a DB Subnet Group**, which consists of **two or more subnets in different AZs** for **Multi-AZ deployments** and **high availability**.

---

## âœ… **Real-Time Use Case**

You are working on a banking application that needs:

* RDS (MySQL) hosted in **private subnet** for security
* EC2 (Web Server) in **public subnet** to access RDS
* Highly available database using **Multi-AZ deployment**

## ðŸ§ª **Step-by-Step Lab: VPC & Subnet Configuration for RDS**

### ðŸ”¨ **Step 1: Create a Custom VPC**

1. Go to **VPC Console â†’ Your VPCs â†’ Create VPC**

   * Name: `custom-rds-vpc`
   * IPv4 CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`
   * Tenancy: Default
   * Click **Create VPC**

---

### ðŸ”¨ **Step 2: Create Subnets**

Create 2 private subnets in 2 AZs:

1. **Subnet 1** (Private)

   * AZ: ap-south-1a
   * CIDR: `10.0.1.0/24`
   * Name: `private-subnet-1`

2. **Subnet 2** (Private)

   * AZ: ap-south-1b
   * CIDR: `10.0.2.0/24`
   * Name: `private-subnet-2`

Create 1 public subnet for EC2:
3\. **Subnet 3** (Public)

* AZ: ap-south-1a
* CIDR: `10.0.3.0/24`
* Name: `public-subnet`

---

### ðŸ”¨ **Step 3: Internet Gateway and Routing (for EC2 only)**

1. Go to **Internet Gateways â†’ Create**

   * Name: `custom-igw`
   * Attach to `custom-rds-vpc`

2. Create a **Route Table** for public subnet

   * Add route: `0.0.0.0/0` â†’ Target: Internet Gateway

3. Associate this route table with `public-subnet`

---

### ðŸ”¨ **Step 4: Create a DB Subnet Group**

1. Go to **RDS â†’ Subnet Groups â†’ Create DB Subnet Group**

   * Name: `rds-subnet-group`
   * VPC: `custom-rds-vpc`
   * Select `private-subnet-1` and `private-subnet-2`

---

### ðŸ”¨ **Step 5: Launch RDS Instance**

1. Go to **RDS â†’ Create database**
2. Engine: MySQL
3. Templates: Production (Multi-AZ)
4. DB Instance ID: `bankdb`
5. DB Subnet Group: `rds-subnet-group`
6. VPC: `custom-rds-vpc`
7. Public access: **No**
8. Availability Zone: Leave default (Multi-AZ will spread across)
9. Storage, Backup, Maintenance â†’ Leave default or configure
10. Create

---

### ðŸ”¨ **Step 6: Launch EC2 in Public Subnet to Connect RDS**

1. Create EC2 Instance (Amazon Linux)

   * VPC: `custom-rds-vpc`
   * Subnet: `public-subnet`
   * Auto-assign public IP: Yes
   * Security Group: Allow **MySQL/Aurora (port 3306)** to **RDS Security Group**
2. SSH into EC2, install MySQL client:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install mysql -y
   ```
3. Connect to RDS:

   ```bash
   mysql -h <RDS-endpoint> -u admin -p
   ```

---

## ðŸ“ˆ **Output / Results**

* Students will see **RDS created in private subnets**
* EC2 connects successfully to the database
* They understand the **network isolation** and **VPC design**

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaways for Students**

| Concept           | Explanation                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| VPC               | Isolated network for RDS and EC2         |
| Subnets           | Separate public and private environments |
| DB Subnet Group   | Mandatory for Multi-AZ and private RDS   |
| Public vs Private | RDS should be private, EC2 can be public |
| Connectivity      | EC2 â†’ RDS connection via private IP      |
