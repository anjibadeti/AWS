## ðŸ”¹ **Topic: Public vs Private RDS Instance**

---

### ðŸ“˜ **Concept Explanation (For Students)**

In AWS RDS, you can choose whether your database instance should be **publicly accessible** or only accessible within your **VPC (Private)**. This is crucial for **security and architectural best practices**.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Public RDS Instance**

* **Definition**: A public RDS instance has a public IP and can be accessed from the internet (with correct security group rules).
* **Use Case**: Used for development or testing environments where ease of access is needed.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Private RDS Instance**

* **Definition**: A private RDS instance does **not** have a public IP. It is accessible **only** from within the VPC, such as from an EC2 instance in the same VPC.
* **Use Case**: Recommended for **production** environments where database access must be tightly controlled.

### ðŸ”’ **Security Best Practices**

| Type    | IP Assigned | Access Scope   | Security Level   |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Public  | Public IP   | Internet       | Low              |
| Private | Private IP  | Internal (VPC) | High (Preferred) |

## ðŸ§ª **Real-Time Example Lab: Deploying Public and Private RDS Instances**

---

### âœ… **Goal**

Deploy one **Public** RDS and one **Private** RDS instance, then access the public one from your local SQL client and the private one from a Bastion EC2.

---

## ðŸ”¨ **Lab Steps: Deploying a Public and Private RDS Instance**

---

### **Step 1: Setup VPC and Subnets**

1. Go to **VPC Console â†’ Create VPC**

   * Name: `rds-vpc`
   * CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`

2. Create **Subnets**:

   * `public-subnet-1` â†’ `10.0.1.0/24` â†’ Enable Auto-assign public IP
   * `private-subnet-1` â†’ `10.0.2.0/24`

3. Create **Internet Gateway** and attach to `rds-vpc`.

4. Create **Route Table** and associate with `public-subnet-1`.

---

### **Step 2: Create DB Subnet Group**

1. Go to **RDS Console â†’ Subnet Groups â†’ Create**

   * Name: `rds-subnet-group`
   * Select both subnets (public and private)

---

### **Step 3: Create Public RDS Instance (MySQL)**

1. Go to **RDS â†’ Create database**

   * Engine: MySQL
   * DB Name: `publicdb`
   * DB Instance Class: `db.t3.micro`
   * Credentials: admin / password123
   * Select Subnet Group: `rds-subnet-group`
   * Public access: **Yes**
   * VPC Security Group: Create new and allow MySQL (3306) from your IP

2. Launch and wait for status `Available`.

---

### **Step 4: Connect to Public RDS**

1. Copy the **endpoint** from RDS.

2. Use **MySQL Workbench** or command-line:

   ```bash
   mysql -h <public-rds-endpoint> -u admin -p
   ```

3. Verify connection.

---

### **Step 5: Create Private RDS Instance (PostgreSQL)**

1. Go to **RDS â†’ Create database**

   * Engine: PostgreSQL
   * DB Name: `privatedb`
   * DB Instance Class: `db.t3.micro`
   * Credentials: admin / password456
   * Subnet Group: `rds-subnet-group`
   * Public Access: **No**
   * VPC Security Group: allow PostgreSQL (5432) from EC2 Bastion

---

### **Step 6: Launch Bastion EC2 in Public Subnet**

1. EC2 â†’ Launch instance

   * AMI: Amazon Linux
   * Subnet: `public-subnet-1`
   * Security Group: Allow SSH from your IP

2. Connect via SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<bastion-ip>
   ```

3. From inside the Bastion host, connect to Private RDS:

   ```bash
   psql -h <private-rds-endpoint> -U admin -d postgres
   ```

---

### âœ… **Validation**

* You should **connect from your laptop** to the **Public RDS**.
* You should **connect from Bastion EC2** to the **Private RDS**.
* You **should not** be able to connect directly to Private RDS from your laptop.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary for Students

| Feature           | Public RDS           | Private RDS             |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Access            | Internet             | VPC Internal (EC2 only) |
| IP                | Public IP            | Private IP              |
| Use Case          | Development, testing | Production, secure data |
| Security Exposure | Higher               | Lower                   |
