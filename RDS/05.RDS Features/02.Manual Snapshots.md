## **Module 5: RDS Features ‚Äî Manual Snapshots**

---

### ‚úÖ **What are Manual Snapshots?**

* Manual snapshots are **user-initiated backups** of your RDS DB instance.
* Unlike **automated backups** (which are deleted when the DB instance is deleted), **manual snapshots persist** until you explicitly delete them.
* Snapshots capture the **entire state of the database** at the time of creation.

### üß† **Why are Manual Snapshots Important?**

| Feature                 | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control**             | You decide when to take the snapshot.                                                 |
| **Long-Term Retention** | Good for archiving specific data states (e.g., before app upgrades).                  |
| **Disaster Recovery**   | You can restore to a previous point by launching a new DB instance from the snapshot. |
| **Portability**         | Snapshots can be copied across regions for cross-region DR setup.                     |

### üíº **Real-Time Use Case:**

Imagine you're about to **deploy a new schema change or software update** on your production DB.
Before applying the change, you take a **manual snapshot**.

üîÑ If the deployment fails, you can **revert** by restoring from the snapshot.

### üß™ **Real-Time Lab: Creating and Using Manual Snapshots**

Let‚Äôs go step-by-step:

---

### **üéØ Objective:**

Create a **manual snapshot** of a MySQL RDS instance and **restore** it later.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Step-by-Step Lab**

#### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Pre-Requisites**

* AWS Free Tier Account
* An existing RDS MySQL instance in running state

---

#### üîπ **Step 2: Take Manual Snapshot**

1. Go to **AWS Console > RDS > Databases**
2. Select your DB instance (e.g., `mydbinstance`)
3. Click on **Actions > Take snapshot**
4. Enter a name: `pre-upgrade-snapshot`
5. Click **Take Snapshot**

‚è≥ **Wait** until the snapshot status becomes **‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù**

---

#### üîπ **Step 3: Verify the Snapshot**

1. Go to **Snapshots > Manual**
2. You'll see `pre-upgrade-snapshot` with status **‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù**

---

#### üîπ **Step 4: Restore DB from Snapshot**

1. Select the snapshot ‚Üí Click **Actions > Restore Snapshot**
2. Enter new DB instance identifier: `restored-mysql-db`
3. Choose instance class (e.g., `db.t3.micro`)
4. Leave other settings default or configure VPC/Security Group as needed
5. Click **Restore DB Instance**

‚è≥ Wait until it reaches the **Available** state

---

#### üîπ **Step 5: Test the Restored DB**

* Connect via MySQL Workbench or EC2 to verify your data is present.
* You can now either promote this DB to production or keep it as backup.

---

### üéì **Teaching Tips for Students**

* Emphasize the difference between **automated** and **manual** backups.
* Encourage them to create manual snapshots **before every major change**.
* Explain the **cost**: snapshots are charged based on the storage they consume.

### üßæ **Where It‚Äôs Used in Real Projects:**

| Use Case               | Description                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pre-upgrade safety** | Before applying schema or application changes          |
| **Compliance archive** | Monthly/Quarterly backups retained for audit           |
| **DR strategy**        | Copying snapshots to another region as backup          |
| **Data migration**     | Restore snapshot into new region/account for migration |
