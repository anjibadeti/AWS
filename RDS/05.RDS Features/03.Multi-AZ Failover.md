## **Module: 5. RDS Features**

### **Topic: Multi-AZ Failover**

---

### **✅ What is Multi-AZ Failover in Amazon RDS?**

Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment is an **RDS high availability feature**. When you enable Multi-AZ for your database, AWS automatically provisions and maintains a **synchronous standby replica** in a different Availability Zone (AZ). It is primarily used for **disaster recovery and high availability**, **not for scaling read traffic** (for that, you use Read Replicas).

---

### **✅ Benefits of Multi-AZ Deployment**

* **High Availability**: Automatic failover to standby in case of DB failure.
* **Data Durability**: Real-time data replication (synchronous).
* **Minimal Downtime**: Automatic detection and failover process.
* **Fully Managed**: AWS handles failover, replication, patching, etc.

---

### **✅ Use Case:**

A banking application that needs **high availability** and **zero data loss** in case of failure. Transactions must not be interrupted due to database issues.

---

### **✅ Components Involved**

* **Primary DB Instance**: Actively serves traffic.
* **Standby DB Instance**: Passive replica in another AZ.
* **Amazon RDS**: Manages the failover, replication, backups.
* **Route53 or RDS DNS Endpoint**: DNS does not change, even during failover.

---

### **✅ Real-Time Example – Step-by-Step Lab**

We will create a **MySQL RDS Multi-AZ instance** using the AWS Console.

---

### **Step 1: Login to AWS Console**

* Go to: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
* Navigate to **RDS** Service.

---

### **Step 2: Launch RDS Instance**

1. Click **“Create Database”**.
2. Select **Standard Create**.
3. **Engine Options**: Choose **MySQL**.
4. **Templates**: Select **Production** (enables Multi-AZ by default).

---

### **Step 3: Configure Settings**

* DB Instance Identifier: `mydb-multi-az`
* Master username: `admin`
* Password: `MySecurePass123!`

---

### **Step 4: DB Instance Settings**

* **DB Instance Class**: `db.t3.medium`
* **Storage Type**: `General Purpose (SSD)`
* Enable **Storage Auto Scaling** if needed.

---

### **Step 5: High Availability**

* In **Availability & Durability** section:

  * ✅ Select **“Create a standby instance (Multi-AZ deployment)”**

---

### **Step 6: Connectivity**

* VPC: Choose existing or default VPC
* Subnet Group: Choose a DB Subnet Group with at least 2 AZs
* Public Access: Yes (if you want to access it publicly for the lab)
* VPC Security Group: Create new or choose existing with port **3306** open

---

### **Step 7: Additional Configuration**

* Enable **Auto backups**
* Backup retention: 7 days
* Monitoring: Optional
* Maintenance: Default

---

### **Step 8: Create Database**

Click **“Create Database”**.

Provisioning will take **5–10 minutes**.

---

### **Step 9: Validate Multi-AZ**

* After creation, go to **RDS Dashboard → Databases**.
* Click on your DB → Scroll down to **Availability & durability**.
* You will see:
  `Multi-AZ DB cluster` – **Yes**
  `Secondary AZ` – `ap-south-1b` (example)

---

### **Step 10: Simulate Failover**

To test automatic failover:

1. Go to **Actions → Reboot with failover**
2. Confirm the operation.

✅ This will force failover to the standby instance.
⏱️ DNS endpoint remains same → Application reconnects automatically.

---

### **✅ Output/Expected Result**

* No manual intervention needed during failover
* Same **endpoint (hostname)** will start pointing to new active instance
* Minimal downtime (\~60–120 seconds)
* No data loss

---

### **✅ When to Use Multi-AZ Failover**

* Production workloads that need **high uptime**
* Financial applications (banking, insurance, etc.)
* Enterprise-level apps with **SLA requirements**

---

### **✅ Notes for Students**

* Multi-AZ is **NOT for performance scaling**
* You are billed for both instances (primary and standby)
* Standby instance **cannot** be used for read traffic
