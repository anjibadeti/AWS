### üìå **Topic: Automated Backups in Amazon RDS**

---

## üî∑ What are Automated Backups in Amazon RDS?

**Automated Backups** is a feature provided by Amazon RDS that enables **point-in-time recovery** of your database instance. AWS automatically takes **daily snapshots** and captures **transaction logs** so you can restore your database to any second within the retention period.

## üéØ Why Are Automated Backups Important?

| Feature                      | Purpose                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| üîÑ **Point-in-time restore** | Recover DB to a specific time     |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **Storage in S3**         | AWS stores backups securely in S3 |
| ‚è≥ **Retention period**       | Keep backups for **1‚Äì35 days**    |
| üîí **Zero admin effort**     | Fully managed, no scripts needed  |
| üö´ **No downtime**           | Performed in the background       |

## üí° Real-World Use Case

> üè• **Healthcare EMR System**:
> A hospital stores **patient medical records** in RDS. An admin mistakenly deletes records during the night. The team needs to **recover the DB as it was at 10:45 PM** without losing new data from the previous day.
> ‚ûú They use **Automated Backups** to perform a **Point-in-Time Restore** and recover the data with **zero manual intervention**.

## üß™ Step-by-Step Lab: Enable and Use Automated Backups

---

### ‚úÖ **Objective**:

* Enable automated backups
* Simulate accidental data deletion
* Perform **point-in-time restore** from a backup

---

### üî∑ Step 1: Create RDS MySQL with Automated Backups

1. Go to **RDS Console ‚Üí Create Database**
2. Engine: MySQL
3. DB Identifier: `medical-db`
4. Backup Settings:

   * Enable Automated Backups ‚úÖ
   * Retention Period: **7 Days**
   * Backup Window: Default (or pick a time)
5. Public access: ‚úÖ Yes (for testing)
6. Security group: Allow port **3306**
7. Click **Create Database**

---

### üî∑ Step 2: Connect to Database and Add Data

Use MySQL client (EC2 or MySQL Workbench):

```bash
mysql -h <endpoint> -u admin -p
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE patients;
USE patients;

CREATE TABLE records (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  diagnosis VARCHAR(100),
  entry_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO records (name, diagnosis) 
VALUES ('John Doe', 'Flu'),
       ('Priya Sharma', 'Diabetes'),
       ('Ali Khan', 'Asthma');
```

---

### üî∑ Step 3: Simulate Accidental Deletion

After a few minutes:

```sql
DELETE FROM records;
```

Run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM records;
-- Result: Empty table
```

---

### üî∑ Step 4: Restore Using Automated Backups (Point-in-Time)

1. Go to **RDS Console ‚Üí Databases**
2. Select `medical-db`
3. Click **Actions ‚Üí Restore to point in time**
4. Choose:

   * **Restore Time**: 1‚Äì2 mins before the DELETE command
   * DB Identifier: `medical-db-restore`
   * Public access: ‚úÖ Yes (for testing)
5. Click **Restore**

üïê Wait until **status = Available**

---

### üî∑ Step 5: Connect to Restored DB

```bash
mysql -h <restored-endpoint> -u admin -p
```

```sql
USE patients;
SELECT * FROM records;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Expected Output:

```text
+----+-------------+-----------+---------------------+
| id | name        | diagnosis | entry_time          |
+----+-------------+-----------+---------------------+
| 1  | John Doe    | Flu       | 2025-07-08 22:40:01 |
| 2  | Priya Sharma| Diabetes  | 2025-07-08 22:41:00 |
| 3  | Ali Khan    | Asthma    | 2025-07-08 22:42:15 |
+----+-------------+-----------+---------------------+
```

üôå Data successfully recovered from a few minutes before deletion.

## üîÅ Difference: Automated Backups vs Snapshots

| Feature          | Automated Backups              | Manual Snapshots          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Scheduling       | Automatic (daily)              | Manual (on-demand)        |
| Retention Period | 1‚Äì35 days                      | Unlimited (until deleted) |
| Point-in-time    | ‚úÖ Supported                    | ‚ùå Not Supported           |
| Cost             | Free for storage up to DB size | Paid per GB-month         |
| Restore To       | Specific time                  | Snapshot time only        |
