## **Module: RDS Features – Maintenance Windows**

---

### ✅ **What is a Maintenance Window in RDS?**

A **Maintenance Window** is a scheduled time period during which **Amazon RDS performs system changes** such as:

* Minor version upgrades (if enabled)
* Operating system patches
* Back-end maintenance activities

These updates ensure **stability, security, and performance** of the RDS infrastructure. Amazon **notifies you** in advance when your DB instance is scheduled for maintenance.

---

### 🧠 **Key Points to Teach Students:**

* Maintenance is **non-disruptive in Multi-AZ**, as it happens on the standby first.
* You can **specify a weekly time window** of 30 minutes or more.
* If no maintenance is scheduled, the window is **unused**.
* **Manual failover** can be used to apply changes at your chosen time.
* You can **defer** or **apply immediately** for certain updates.

## 🧩 **Real-Time Use Case Example:**

**Use Case:**
A financial application runs on a **PostgreSQL RDS instance**. To avoid downtime during business hours, the DevOps team wants **all OS patching and RDS engine upgrades** to happen **every Sunday at 2:00 AM** (off-peak).

This is configured using the **RDS Maintenance Window** setting.

## 🧪 **Step-by-Step Lab: Set Maintenance Window in Amazon RDS**

> We'll create a PostgreSQL RDS instance and set a custom maintenance window.

### 🛠️ **Step 1: Launch an RDS PostgreSQL Instance**

1. Go to AWS Console → RDS → **Create database**
2. Choose:

   * **Standard create**
   * **Engine:** PostgreSQL
   * **Edition:** Free tier
   * **DB Instance Identifier:** `postgres-maintenance-db`
   * **Master username/password:** `admin / Password123!`
3. Scroll to **Additional configuration**

   * Under **Maintenance**, click **Set maintenance window**
   * Choose:

     * **Day:** Sunday
     * **Start Time:** 02:00 AM
     * **Duration:** 30 minutes
4. Leave all other settings as default.

### 🔍 **Step 2: View Maintenance Settings**

After the DB is created:

1. Go to **RDS → Databases**
2. Click on `postgres-maintenance-db`
3. Scroll to **Maintenance & backups**
4. You’ll see:

   * **Maintenance window:** `Sun:02:00 - 02:30`
   * **Auto minor version upgrade:** Enabled/Disabled
   * **Pending maintenance actions:** If any updates are available

---

### 🔄 **Step 3: Simulate or Apply Pending Maintenance (Optional)**

If there's a pending maintenance:

1. Navigate to **Maintenance & backups**
2. If listed, click on **Apply now** or **Defer**
3. You can **monitor logs** and **CloudWatch** for behavior during the window

## 📘 **Key Lab Learning Outcomes:**

* Students learn how to control when AWS performs updates.
* Understand behavior difference in **Single-AZ vs Multi-AZ**
* Learn to **avoid peak hours** for critical updates.
* Demonstrate **real-world scheduling scenarios**.

---

## 📝 **Best Practices to Share with Students:**

* Always set maintenance during **non-business hours**.
* Use **Multi-AZ** to ensure no downtime during updates.
* Monitor upcoming updates using **AWS CLI** or **RDS Console**.
* Review **Release Notes** of engine updates before applying.
