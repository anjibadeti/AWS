## 🔷 **What are Read Replicas?**

Read Replicas are **read-only copies** of your primary RDS DB instance. AWS performs **asynchronous replication** to keep replicas updated. Read Replicas help:

* Offload read-heavy workloads
* Improve performance
* Support use cases like analytics, reporting, and disaster recovery ([AWS Documentation][1], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2], [Medium][3])

---

## 🔄 **Key Use Cases**

1. **Scaling Reads**: Offload SELECT queries to replicas to ease primary instance load ([AWS Documentation][1], [DEV Community][4])
2. **Disaster Recovery / HA**: Promote a Replica to standalone DB in primary failure ([AWS Documentation][1])
3. **Reporting / BI**: Run analytics or ETL jobs on replicas without impacting production ([AWS Documentation][1])
4. **Cross-region replication**: Serve geo-distributed users with local replicas ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 📊 **Architecture Overview**

```
Primary (R/W)
   │
   │── async replication ──▶ Read Replica 1 (R)
   │                       Read Replica 2 (R)
   │
(Optional) Cross-region Replica
```

You can **promote a replica**, making it the new primary if needed ([AWS Documentation][5]).

## 🛠️ **Real-Time Use Case**

A **news website** suffers from slow response times during peak traffic (hundreds of thousands of daily reads). Instead of upgrading the master DB, they deploy **5 Read Replicas** to distribute read traffic, improving performance without affecting write operations.

## 🧪 **Hands‑On Lab: Creating and Promoting Read Replicas**

---

### 🎯 **Lab Objectives**

* Launch primary RDS instance
* Create Read Replica(s)
* Connect to the replica and verify replication
* Promote a replica to a standalone DB

---

### 🔧 **Step 1: Create a Primary RDS Instance (MySQL)**

1. AWS Console → RDS → **Create database**
2. Engine: **MySQL**
3. Identifier: `primary-db`
4. Master username/password
5. Class: `db.t3.medium`
6. Enable automated backups (required for replicas)
7. Public Access: Yes (for lab)
8. Launch and wait for status → **Available**

---

### 🔧 **Step 2: Populate Primary DB**

Connect via MySQL client and run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE newsdb;
USE newsdb;

CREATE TABLE articles (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  headline VARCHAR(255), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO articles (headline) VALUES ('Breaking: AWS Read Replicas!'), ('Learn RDS scaling');
```

---

### 🔧 **Step 3: Create a Read Replica**

1. In RDS Console → **Databases** → Select `primary-db`
2. **Actions → Create Read Replica**
3. Identifier: `replica-db`
4. Class: `db.t3.medium`
5. Public Access: Yes
6. Launch & wait for “Available”

---

### 🔧 **Step 4: Verify Read Replica Content**

Connect to replica:

```bash
mysql -h <replica-endpoint> -u admin -p
```

Then:

```sql
USE newsdb;
SELECT * FROM articles;
```

✅ You should see both inserted rows replicated.

---

### 🔧 **Step 5: Simulate Primary Write and Confirm Replication**

On primary:

```sql
INSERT INTO articles (headline) VALUES ('Replica tested!');
```

On replica, after a delay:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles;
```

✅ You should see the new row, verifying replication.

---

### 🔧 **Step 6: Promote Read Replica**

If primary fails, you can convert replica into standalone:

1. RDS Console → Select `replica-db` → **Actions → Promote**
2. Confirm the promotion
3. After reboot, `replica-db` is now a primary — writable
